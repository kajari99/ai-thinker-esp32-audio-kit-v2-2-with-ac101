I have archived the libraries used for the project here in the libraries.

The libraries are contained in the "src" folders.


Origin of libraries:

https://github.com/schreibfaul1/ESP32-audioI2S

https://github.com/Yveaux/AC101

https://github.com/ESP32Async/AsyncTCP.git

https://github.com/michalmonday/CSV-Parser-for-Arduino

https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncWebServer

Comment:


Library owners can modify the support.  Therefore, it only works stably in archive state without updating libraries!


Attention! Arduino IDE is prone to automatic library updates!
