The ORIGINAL project with ES8388 CODEC from: https://github.com/thieu-b55/ESP32-audiokit-webradio-webinterface/blob/main/ESP32_webradio_audiokit.ino   Copyright (c) 2022 thieu-b55


I modified thieu-b55's project to work with the ac101 audio codec, and added the buttons to use it.


I have archived the libraries used for the project here in the libraries.

Comment:

The ESP32 A1S AC101(ESP32-DOWD version1) is outdated and contains bugs, but can still be used with the old libraries.
It is recommended to use ESP32-A1S ES8388 (ESP32-DOWD version 3).
